Stepping Stones is a platform where mothers can keep track of their kids milestones as well as plan and meet them. The milestones created by users are public therefore this platform is meant to be anonymous and real names are not required, in order to add a level of comfortability and transparancy. 

The users can signup, and login. 
They can create Milestones, as well as update and delete them.
